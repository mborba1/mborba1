### Hi there, I am Margareth ðŸ‘‹
- I have been working on technical field for about 15 years as a Systems Engineer/Application Support/Site Reliability Engineer. Never coded before, and after the re-org on my last employer, my job was outsourced to a consulting company, I realized I need to get my skills in check. I decided to join a bootcamp program to learn how to code. That made me fall in love with programming and now want to re-invent my career to become a software engineer.
- Recently, I just completed a 17 week immersive software engineering program centered on fullstack at the Grace Hopper program at FullStack Academy where I learned JavaScript/React/Redux/Node.js and so much more.
- I've worked on a few projects during that time:

   https://github.com/2106-GH-DivvyUp/DivvyUp - A mobile app that splits the bill for you. Just take a picture of your receipt, 
   add number of people & method of splitting, and submit your charge requests.
 
   https://graceshopper-rtmj.herokuapp.com/ - A fully deployed e-commerce web-app featuring a product catalog and persistent user sessions.
 
   https://github.com/mborba1/SellYourStuff - A react native app where users post items for sell, buy items and search by category.
